# Pluto's Pizza
This is the frontend repo for a pizza ordering app.

[Backend Repo](https://github.com/lanxeyu/plutos-pizza-server)
## How to Run:
1. Clone this repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/)


## Future improvements:
### Code
1. Dynamically generate size buttons so that modifying the Pizza class according to changes in the business's size offerings will work seamlessly with the existing code.
2. Modifying a pizza's size is handled by the Pizza class method, but modifying its toppings is handled by the React component. One or the other should be changed to increase readability and conformity.

1. Confirmation dialog box after clicking the 'Place Order' button
2. Images for pizza sizes and toppings
3. Minimum order amount
4. Minimum toppings selection
5. Confirm pizza deletion
6. Account system
