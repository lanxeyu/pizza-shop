# Pluto's Pizza
## Future improvements:
### Code
1. Dynamically generate size buttons so that modifying the Pizza class according to changes in the business's size offerings will work seamlessly with the existing code.
2. Modifying a pizza's size is handled by the Pizza class method, but modifying its toppings is handled by the React component. One or the other should be changed to increase readability and conformity.
### Features
1. Use images for the toppings selector component.
