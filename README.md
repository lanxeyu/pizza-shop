# Pluto's Pizza
## Future improvements:
### Code
1. Dynamically generate size buttons so that modifying the Pizza class according to changes in the business's size offerings will work seamlessly with the existing code.
2. Adding a new pizza to the cart is handled by the Pizza class method, but removing it from the cart is handled by the React component. One or the other should be changed to increase readability and conformity.
3. Modifying a pizza's size is handled by the Pizza class method, but modifying its toppings is handled by the React component. One or the other should be changed to increase readability and conformity.
### Features
1. Use images for the toppings selector component.
